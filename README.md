# DATA-MASTER-CHALLLENGE
The client, a large real estate investment trust, is facing rising energy costs, carbon penalties, and operational inefficiencies across its 1,600 commercial buildings. EcoSmart Solutions has engaged our team of data analysts to develop data-driven strategies that will reduce energy waste by 20% over the next two years. However, the energy usage data is highly fragmented, containing missing values, anomalies, and complex seasonal trends that need to be addressed before actionable insights can be generated. Through a structured process involving data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling, our goal is to uncover key insights that will guide the clientâ€™s infrastructure investments. These findings will directly support the client in achieving its ambitious sustainability and operational efficiency objectives.
